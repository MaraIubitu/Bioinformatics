Main issue with this algorithmic approach: Greedy overlap-based assembly from random reads often fails or produces misassemblies when the original sequence contains repeats or low-complexity regions. Reads that come from repeated regions produce ambiguous overlaps so the assembler may choose incorrect joins (local optima). Insufficient or uneven coverage, sequencing errors, and choice of minimum overlap threshold also affect correctness. More robust approaches (de Bruijn graphs, statistical models, paired reads) and careful error handling are required for reliable reconstruction."
